## Key changes made to index.html

```

1. Changed the title of the webpage to correctly display the company name
2. Replaced all of the div tags with appropriate semantic tags.  Largely used the section tag, but opted for the aside tag in the benefits box on 3. the right hand side of the page
4. Added a class "top-links" in the header section section.  This addition allowed me to keep better track of the new class in CSS.
5. Added alt tags to all images for screen reader accomodations
6. Changed the div tag for the main image to the figure tag
